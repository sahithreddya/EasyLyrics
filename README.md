# .txt-to-.lrc-converter
A .txt file converter which takes in the song title, artist and song lyrics as input and combines them to make a downloadable lyric(.lrc) file.
A .lrc file is used in some music players(Xiaomi default music player) to display the lyrics of a song in sync with the song playing. 
The file contains a timestamp before each line which matches the time of the vocals in the song.
A youtube player is embedded in the page to help the user to sync with more precision.

>Future feature additions : <br>
*'Backspace' in between syncing where the timer goes back to the previous timestamp in case the user misses the a line by mistake.<br>
*Local audio file player in the page to help the users who want lyric files for the locally saved music, which isn't always same as the youtube audio.
